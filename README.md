# CCC Materials

Hi there ~~

This repo contains my materials for the [CCC (Canadian Computing Competition)](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/ccc-cco.html), including:
- `testrunner.c`: a simple C script designed for Windows CMD that runs test data (those `.in` and `.out` files) locally and compares output. All four languages supported by CCC are accepted -- C++, C, Python and Java.
- Past contest solutions:
    * Currently I focus on the Junior division and only solve junior problems.
    * I use C/C++ for competitive programming.
    * Files with `_re` suffix (e.g. `j5_re.cpp`) mean a "redo" and are better than the original ones (e.g. `j5.cpp`) and usually pass more subtasks.
    * *NEEDING HELP* on:
        - 2019 J5's final subtask. It seems that the original test data didn't include cases for this subtask, so I could pass that. But the extended data set (found on [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc19j5)) would make it a TLE.
    * All other solutions that exist in this repo *should* get a full mark -- I have only tested them locally so errors like MLE may not be found.

GOOD LUCK TO EVERY CODER ~~
